    "# Requirements Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements Engineering is a huge topic. Oxford's Software Engineering M.Sc. programme includes a [week-long course on Requirements Engineering](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/subjects/REN.html), and here we are shrinking it into half of a single lesson. The best we can hope is that you gain an appreciation for the topic, some ideas about how to think about the requirements for your own software, and the motivation to go and learn more and put your understanding into practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are requirements?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the face of it, this seems like an easy question to answer. A requirement is anything that you need the software to do. First, a quibble: it's anything that _somebody_ needs the software to do. These needs can be in conflict at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, appreciate that not everything software must do relates to a button on a screen with a corresponding action. At a high level, requirements engineers often differentiate _functional_ and _non-functional_ requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional requirement is something you expect the software to do. For example, \"the software takes a sequence of amino acids entered by the user and calculates a likely structure for a folded protein\" would be a functional requirement. So would \"the software stores the positions of the atoms in the folded protein in a file using the PDB format\". Notice that details about the _technical_ implementation are left out of the requirements: yes we mention the PDB format, presumably because that has value to the user to interchange with other tools or deposit into a public database, but we don't say _how_ the user enters the amino acid sequence. Do they type text? Drag and drop? Those are _design_ issues, not _requirements_ issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that somebody needs of the software that isn't a thing it does is a non-functional requirement. The reason for explicitly mentioning that is that there are many different categories of non-functional requirement, and it's easy to overlook particular aspects of a system's behaviour if you are not primed to think of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often non-functional requirements are described as the \"-ilities\" of a system, because they include things like accessibility, usability, and similar words. A non-exhaustive list of types of non-functional requirements, with examples, is given here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usability\n",
    " - The system must be understandable by a person with undergraduate knowledge of plate tectonics, but no particular experience with machine vision.\n",
    " - The app will be used by participants drawn from the public and should be usable with only a one-screen introduction.\n",
    "- Performance\n",
    " - The system must handle a mean load of 100 users per hour, with peak loads of 1,200 users per hours for periods of up to 30 minutes.\n",
    " - The system must respond to a user's request within 250ms.\n",
    "- Operations\n",
    " - The system must run on the Archer2 cluster.\n",
    " - Users can expect no more than eight hours of downtime in a calendar year.\n",
    "- Security\n",
    " - Confidentiality and integrity of participant data is consistent with the requirements of the GDPR.\n",
    " - Data on the users' device is encrypted with the AES-256 cipher in GCM mode and protected by a passcode.\n",
    "- Accessibility\n",
    " - The app can be used by blind users with screen reader software.\n",
    " - The visualisations must be interpretable by colour-blind users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documenting Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss methodology later in this session, but it's useful to know that Agile teams often record their requirements in a lightweight \"user story\" format that expresses who wants to do what, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a pharmacologist, I want to visualise the folded protein structure of a given amino acid sequence so that I can determine its effectiveness at blocking a particular enzymatic reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"story\" in \"user story\" does not refer to that sentence, but to the stories team members tell each other when collaborating on implementing that requirement. The format is intentionally light on detail, forcing engineers to discuss the requirement and build a concensus meaning as they work on constructing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less fashionable is the detailed \"requirements specification\", a document that describes precisely what the software will do. In research software, a big level of upfront detail may be more appropriate than in the world of commercial web apps in which user stories are particularly prevalent. For example, if the software is to simulate a specific model of galaxy formation, then the functional requirements could be a whole published journal paper or D.Phil thesis describing the mathematics of the model in sufficient detail to translate into an algorithm. Conversely usability requirements may be left very vague, as the software is to be used by one research group who all share an office and can train each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An aside on philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me paint two different pictures of requirements engineering. The first is probably the one that informed the term, when Thayer and Dorfman introduced the term in their 1995 book _System and Software Requirements Engineering_. The second basically subverts everything that's present in the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first picture, there is an ideal form that the software we want to build could take. The requirements are out there, flitting about like butterflies. They are real things that exist in the world. Our job as requirements engineers is to use our skilful engineering techniques like butterfly nets, capturing these requirements and pinning them to our development project. The more requirements we capture and the more carefully and precisely we pin them down, the better our software will become. When we have sufficiently elucidated the software requirements, we're ready to build the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second picture, there is no ideal software because the act of introducing the software into the system, or even talking about possible software with stakeholders, changes the system. As people come and go, the system changes, the way that they work changes, and so the software that would best support the people changes. Our role as requirements engineers is to observe the people in their context, to hypothesise changes, implement and observe the results of those changes. There's never \"enough\" software requirements because there's no end goal: just an evolutionary process of change and adaptation from both us and our users. There's also no \"right\" software to build, just fitness for context that changes as both the software and the context change.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pictures clearly represent two very different ways to think about a software system and its requirements, and can be considered as two ends of a continuum. Depending on the problem, the people, the rate at which both of those things change, and who you ask, you may get a different view on where your situation sits in the continuum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements Elicitation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal Donors vs. Gold Owners\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any elicitation activity can be undertaken, you need to work out who the correct people to talk to are. Business project management resources glibly refer to \"the stakeholders\", as if your role is akin to Jonathan Harker in Dracula, seeking the help of Van Helsing. In reality there will be different roles, assumed by (potentially) different people, with differing and probably even conflicting needs. Keeping all of these people happy, or maybe minimally unhappy, is at the heart of the requirements engineering problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of the Patterns Language of Programming movement, the community invented the term [Goal Donor](http://wiki.c2.com/?GoalDonor) to describe someone who creates the software team's goals, and [Gold Owner](http://wiki.c2.com/?GoldOwner) to describe someone who pays for the team's work. It's important to realise that these are often different people, who have different expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a research software project, the Goal Donor is likely to be the Principal Investigator, while the Gold Owner will be the research council or other grant-awarding body. Luckily, they probably both have similar objectives, to produce high-impact research in a particular field. But those aren't likely to be the only people with opinions on how the software should work. If it's destined to be run on University computers or in a high-performance computing centre, the support staff may have certain rules or policies that affect your software project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The people _using_ the software may not be the P.I. or the research council, they may be research assistants, technicians, D.Phil. students, or members of the public. Their ability to use the software is an important factor in its success. When the public are involved, then so may be your institution's marketing department and ethics review board.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elicitation Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick list of techniques used, organised into four quadrants based on whether the requirements engineer is a passive or active participant, and on whether the stakeholders are involved individually or as a group. The list is not exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Passive Engineer, Individual Stakeholder\n",
    "  - Usability labs\n",
    "  - Questionnaire\n",
    " - Passive Engineer, Multiple Stakeholders\n",
    "  - Video recording in context\n",
    "  - Realist ethnography\n",
    " - Active Engineer, Individual Stakeholder\n",
    "  - Interview\n",
    "  - Guided usability study or prototype feedback\n",
    " - Active Engineer, Multiple Stakeholders\n",
    "  - Critical ethnography\n",
    "  - Focus groups\n",
    "  - Brainstorming sessions\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Notes on Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "People may behave differently in a group setting than an individual setting. Example: defer to HIPPO (HIghest-Paid Person's Opinion) when they're in the room, speak up when they're alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "People may say one thing, but do another. Or they may do one thing in a realistic context and another in a lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questionnaires: pay attention to Acquiescence Bias (people tend to agree with you) when you use Likert Scales.\n",
    "\n",
